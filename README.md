# Samaritan mobile app
Freely donate food, cloths, and other items to those in need (who can't afford):

## Why Samaritan
**Throwing away food is like stealing from the poor, Pope Francis**. There are people out there suffering and in need of a days meal but due to one reason or the other, they can't have. 
But then, there are others leaving in great plentiful and even throwing away alot. 
It doesn't end at food alone, it goes right to dresses, shows and other items which people may have in excess and are not using them. 

Samaritan is a platform promoting the giving culture of freely giving/donating food and other items you have in excess and ain't going to use them.

## How to. 
In 30 days, we are building

3. Database using mongo DB
At the end od the process, we'll have an Android and iOS app on both stores respectively
